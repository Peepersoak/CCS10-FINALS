            A dry or semi-dry scrubbing system, unlike the wet scrubber, does
            not saturate the flue gas stream that is being treated with
            moisture. In some cases no moisture is added, while in others only
            the amount of moisture that can be evaporated in the flue gas
            without condensing is added. Therefore, dry scrubbers generally do
            not have a stack steam plume or wastewater handling/disposal
            requirements. Dry scrubbing systems are used to remove acid gases
            (such as SO2 and HCl) primarily from combustion sources. There are a
            number of dry type scrubbing system designs. However, all consist of
            two main sections or devices: a device to introduce the acid gas
            sorbent material into the gas stream and a particulate matter
            control device to remove reaction products, excess sorbent material
            as well as any particulate matter already in the flue gas. Dry
            scrubbing systems can be categorized as dry sorbent injectors (DSIs)
            or as spray dryer absorbers (SDAs). Spray dryer absorbers are also
            called semi-dry scrubbers or spray dryers. Dry scrubbing systems are
            often used for the removal of odorous and corrosive gases from
            wastewater treatment plant operations. The medium used is typically
            an activated alumina compound impregnated with materials to handle
            specific gases such as hydrogen sulfide.

            Media used can be mixed together to offer a wide range of removal
            for other odorous compounds such as methyl mercaptans, aldehydes,
            volatile organic compounds, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl
            disulfide. Dry sorbent injection involves the addition of an
            alkaline material (usually hydrated lime, soda ash, or sodium
            bicarbonate) into the gas stream to react with the acid gases. The
            sorbent can be injected directly into several different locations:
            the combustion process, the flue gas duct (ahead of the particulate
            control device), or an open reaction chamber (if one exists). The
            acid gases react with the alkaline sorbents to form solid salts
            which are removed in the particulate control device. These simple
            systems can achieve only limited acid gas (SO2 and HCl) removal
            efficiencies. Higher collection efficiencies can be achieved by
            increasing the flue gas humidity (i.e., cooling using water spray).
            These devices have been used on medical waste incinerators and a few
            municipal waste combustors. In spray dryer absorbers, the flue gases
            are introduced into an absorbing tower (dryer) where the gases are
            contacted with a finely atomized alkaline slurry. Acid gases are
            absorbed by the slurry mixture and react to form solid salts which
            are removed by the particulate control device. The heat of the flue
            gas is used to evaporate all the water droplets, leaving a
            non-saturated flue gas to exit the absorber tower. Spray dryers are
            capable of achieving high (80+%) acid gas removal efficiencies.
            These devices have been used on industrial and utility boilers and
            municipal waste incinerators.
